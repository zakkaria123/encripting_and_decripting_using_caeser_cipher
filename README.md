# encripting_and_decripting_using_caeser_cipher
i use the rules behind the Caeser Cipher to create a python rule to implement the encryption and decryption of data as used by white heart hackers to share data
given an alphabet, we chose a decryption or encription key that we add or subtract to the index of the value in the data,
for encrytioon: if the value is above 25, we get its module when divided by 26(since alphabets total=26)
For decryption if we get a value <0, we add 26 and get the position of the index
with this kind of hacking,i can somehow hide data
